## Process
We started by extracting alot of SVGs from poster 2 and implementing the non animated elements. After that we began with the background and footer since it was the easiest. Then we started to add the SVGs that we where going to animate. After animating the SVGs we started to build the page so it would look good.
Then we did adjustment and had some issues with the scaling but fixed it.

## Animated Elements
We animated the moon, stars, car and the clouds. 
### Moon
The moon is spinning around 360 deg which makes it feel more alive. We coded it with keyframes line 156 in the scss file.
### Stars
We wanted the stars to be different so we made them rotate the opposite way of eachother which looks better, if all elements rotated the same way it would be boring.
### Car
We animated the car to go up and down by using translateY(-10px) so it would move along the Y axis. We moved it along the Y-axis so it would look like driving. Line 156 in SCSS.
### Clouds
The cloud uses the same bounce effect as the car only it's slower. It was a nice detail since it brings more life to the picture.
### CSS drawing
The polygon was from the SVG lecture page 61 and we used a path to make it go off screen.
